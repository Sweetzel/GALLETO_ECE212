Everything has changed because of covid, we always stay at home so our work and studies are at home too. So in order for us to do it, we should need computer, laptops, smartphones and other gadgets that could help us communicate to others through those devices. But before that, we should know how to understand or use the computer programs cause that is what we are going to use to make it all happen. Indeed, we should know and learn about computer programs cause it is the main of all. A simple computer program is capable of turning things around as you want.\n"
