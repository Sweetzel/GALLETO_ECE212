    "\n",
    "Since Covid 19 started, we just stay at home and all works and schools are on freeze like we cannot do what our normal days are going. Everything has changed because of covid, we always stay at home so our work and studies are at home too. So in order for us to do it, we should need computer, laptops, smartphones and other gadgets that could help us communicate to others through those devices. But before that, we should know how to understand or use the computer programs cause that is what we are going to use to make it all happen. Indeed, we should know and learn about computer programs cause it is the main of all. A simple computer program is capable of turning things around as you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "2 If you were able to learn computer program what program will you code? Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "If I were able to learn computer program it would be python, since I started learning about it in the coursera and I observed that python is easy to use and versatile, making it a great choice to learn for beginners. It allows us to think like a programmer and not wasting our time with confusing syntax.\n",
    "\n",
    "3 What would be your primary motivation in learning programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "I did not imagine myself learning programming but then I'm an engineering student and I have to learn about it. While I'm learning about it, I just realized that learning programming brought us a lot of good things. First, I observed while learning Python making codes or coding develops structured and develops our creative thinking. Programming makes things easier for us because in just a simple computer program is capable of turning things around as what you wanted it to be.\n",
